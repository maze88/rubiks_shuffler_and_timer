## Rubik's Cube Shuffler and Timer
This project is for people who like practicing solving Rubik's cubes, it allows the user to time their solves (while saving stats for the current session), and generates random move sequences in order to shuffle their cube.

For more information on Rubik's cube solving check out these two links:
- https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/ - This explains the notation used for the shuffle moves (worth reviewing, if you want to AT LEAST understand this project).
- https://solvethecube.com/ - Here you can learn to solve the cube yourself (if you're feeling a bit ambitious today!).
